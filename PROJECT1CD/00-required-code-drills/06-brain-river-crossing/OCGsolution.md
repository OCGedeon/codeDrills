The farmer grabbed the chicken first. 
Since the fox does not eat the grain it would be safe while we was away. 
The farmer then would come back and grab the fox and bring him over. 
At the same time the farmer would take the chicken with him on the return trip to get the grain. 
Once the farmer gets back to the grain he will leave the chicken and grab the grain and drop it over with the fox.
Finally he will return to the chicken and bring it over with the fox and grain.
